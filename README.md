# Game Engine Repo
This is a repo that contains my work that I will be doing on the gaem engine module.  
The differnt labs that I will be completing during the module to help me learn and understand how to create a game engine in c++ using OpenGL are inside diffent branches on the repo. The first 3D game scene with a model in it is on lab 5. 


## My Game Theme
I have decided to go with the Wild West/Western desert theme.

## Overview of game scene (My idea)
In the game scene I will haev differnt models these will include:
* Multiple diffent models of Cactus
* Horse
* Tumbleweed (not implemented)
* Saloon
* Cowboy Cart


There will be a yellow/oraange sandy fog.  

I will be implementign fog, a hud, ans ome real time user controls of settings.

I will also be implementing instancing to help create multiple tumbleweeds and cactus.

I would also like to implement in, bump mapping, Lighting/shadows, and particle effects.

My Current progress in the game world is shown with the picture below. This is my current final update. I have added in soem addition ui to show a map, fps count and fog density. There are texture models and and a terrain that uses a hieght map. I have added in the abilty to add both a sky dome and a skybox.

# Progress Points (Labs)
Whilst creatign the game egine I have been completing diffent labs to code up sections of the engine. Below here are pictures from each Lab showing what progrss was made between them. Each new lab includes the fetur made in the previous lab, so to see the most up to date version of the project go to the latest lab. For more information on the labs and some perfomace profilling, go the the lab branhces. 

## Lab 1 was a first look at using openGL
