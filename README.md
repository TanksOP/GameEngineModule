# Game Engine Repo
This is a repo that contains my work that I will be doing on the gaem engine module.  
The differnt labs that I will be completing during the module to help me learn and understand how to create a game engine in c++ using OpenGL are inside diffent branches on the repo. The first 3D game scene with a model in it is on lab 5. 


## My Game Theme
I have decided to go with the Wild West/Western desert theme.

## Overview of game scene (My idea)
In the game scene I will haev differnt models these will include:
* Multiple diffent models of Cactus
* Horse
* Tumbleweed
* Saloon
* Cowboy Cart

I will have tumbleweed, set with preprogrammed movemnt that will move accross the screen.  
There will be a yellow/oraange sandy fog.  

I would like to implement Level of Detail into the world, as at a further distance the objects won't need to be renderd in as high quality especially since i am planning on adding in fog, which might mean at some points some obects can barly bee seen so don't need to be high quality.

I will also be implementing instancing to help create multiple tumbleweeds and cactus.

I would also like to implement in, bump mapping, Lighting/shadows, and particle effects.
